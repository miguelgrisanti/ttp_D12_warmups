-- hint #1
-- take a moment to think about which columns you'll actually need to do this There's only a few.
-- You'll want to be able to produce a result where there's 1 row for each order, with the necessary
-- columns for each order included.









-- hint #2 
-- You then need create a new column that is the date of the previous order to the current order, and do 
-- that for each customer, so that you can calculate the time interval between orders (for each customer)
-- what does this sound like?










--hint #3
-- That's right, a window function. You need to generate a window function, wrap that query into a CTE.
-- and calculate an interval. Once you can do the intervals between purchases, you should be able to 
-- get all the necesary outputs.
